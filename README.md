# template-autograding-cpp23

*Learning Autograding with C++23 - Prof. Igor Machado Coelho*

This activity demonstrates basic functionality from C++23, including `import std;` and CXX Modules.
Testing is done with boost::ut library, that currently supports modules.
To build this activity, use CMake 4.0 with ninja. Tested on compilers GCC 15 and Clang 19.

**IMPORTANT:** If autograding (GitHub Actions) doesn't start for you, *check again the Invitation Link for
the activity* and hit the link named **update**.

If you want to practice this activity, just follow this link: (TODO: update)

## Problem Description

This part describes the activity. This example activity consists in fixing two functions: one that adds two integers, and another that multiplies two integers.

## Objective

- Make the code pass correctly on all tests
   * only change the allowed files to achieve this goal (see instructions below with specific rules).

- The GitHub Actions should present a green marker when all tests are satisfied, and a red X when some (or all) of tests fail. 
    * **Advice:** You can click on the red X to verify which tests have failed (or if code didn't compile correctly).
    * **Advice 2:** If no autograding test appear, it may be required for the **instructor** to *update the test activities*, so that all student repos are refreshed (regarding autograding).

## Instructions

- You can ONLY change files `src/student.cppm` and `README.md`!
   * In file `src/student.cppm` put your implementations, and in `README.md` put your full name.

Explanations for the other files:

- file `tests/tests.cpp` has all tests for the activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file `makefile` has the general Unix Makefile commands for executing activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file `CMakeLists.txt` has the CMake commands for executing activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file  `build/app_tests` will be generated after compiling (if you want to test locally, just execute it)

## Commands for Local Testing

- Command to build and execute tests: `make test`
    * If executable is built already, just type: `./build/app_tests`

## Notes

- The code will be evaluated only if compiling! 
   * The reason is, if it doesn't compile, it won't be possible to generate the executable and to perform tests.

- Some test cases may receive individual grade, while others may only receive grade if passing together (or even all tests passing together).

- The final grade will be given automatically on every *commit*, and will only be evaluated until the deadline of the activity.

- The deadline is defined in GitHub Classroom
   * in case you cannot find it, ask the instructor or the course webpage

Check all other rules with instructor.
